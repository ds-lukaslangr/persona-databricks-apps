# **Project Requirements Document: The Persona App**

The following table outlines the detailed functional requirements of The Persona website.

| Requirement ID | Description               | User Story                                                                                       | Expected Behavior/Outcome                                                                                                     |
|-----------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FR001          | Creating a New Segment   | As a user, I want to be able to start a new Segment, so I can begin adding attribute conditions.              | The system should provide a clear way for the user to initiate the creation of a new Segment by a "Create segment" button. |
| FR002          | Displaying available attributes    | As a user, I want to be able to see which attributes (columns of the input table)are available to me for creating conditions. | The system should provide a list of columns of the input table with data type and a  business description of each column.                              |
| FR003          | Adding a Segment condition    | As a user, I want to be to create a Segment by adding conditions one by one and thereby narrowing the set of input table rows filtered by those conditions. I want to be able to add a range condition for numerical columns and a multiselect condition on a distinct list of values of string columns. I want to see the number of rows of the input table that satisfy the conjunction of created conditions. | The system should provide a button "Add condition" which then allows the user to select a column from a list of input table columns and depending on if it's a numerical type or a string type to specify either a range condition or a multiselect one. Upon adding a condition the system should run a filter query of all combined conditions and show a count of resulting rows.               |
| FR004          | Save segment    | As a user, I want to be able to name the segment and save it with all its conditions. | The system should provide a way for users to save the segments as files identifiable by a Segment name.                                                                      |
| FR005          | Retrieve a saved segment | As a user, I want to be able to retrieve a Segment by picking from a list of all saved segments identified by names. | The system should provide a list of all saved segments and upon selection, load that segment into the user interface with editable conditions the same way as if the user was just creating that segment and it should run the row count of the combined conditions of that Segment.                                                                        |
| FR006          | Exporting a Segment  | As a user, I want to be able to export the rows of the input table into multiple formats - CSV, JSON and parquet. | The system should provide an interface to select the export format and upon clicking an "Export" button to run the filter query given by the combined conditions of the Segment and produce a resulting table in the specified format.     |
| FR007          | Automatic URL Generation  | As a user, if I don't want to think of a custom URL, I want the system to automatically create one for my list so I can still share it. | The system should generate a unique and shareable URL for the list if the user doesn't provide one.                                                               |                                                          |
| FR012          | Deleting a Segment           | As a user, I want to be able to delete a Segment if I no longer need it.                    | The system should provide a way for users to delete a Segment, including all conditions.                                                             |
